    "Hugging Face zero-shot sentiment analysis uses zero-shot learning (ZSL), which refers to building a model and using it to make predictions on tasks the model was not trained to do. It can be used on any text classification task, including but not limited to sentiment analysis and topic modeling.  \n",

    "Zero-shot sentiment analysis from Hugging Face is a use case of the Hugging Face zero-shot text classification model. It is a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model where two sequences are compared to see if they contradict each other, entail each other, or are neutral (neither contradict nor entail).  \n",
    "  \n",
    "When using the Hugging Face zero-shot sentiment analysis, we will have the text as the premise and the sentiment labels such as positive and negative as hypotheses. If the model predicts that a text document entails positive, then the document is predicted to have a positive sentiment. Otherwise, the document is predicted to have a negative sentiment.  \n",
