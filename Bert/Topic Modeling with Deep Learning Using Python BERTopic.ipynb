Compared with other dimension reduction techniques such as PCA (Principle Component Analysis), UMAP maintains the data’s local and global structure when reducing the dimensionality, which is important for representing the semantics of the text data. BERTopic provides the option of using other dimensionality reduction techniques by changing the umap_model value in the BERTopic method.  \n",
